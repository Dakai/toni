#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   pinned to vastly different versions as others using the same project, you may need to omit
#   this file. You can also use `pipenv --skip-lock` on install or update in order to avoid
#   writing lock file.
